iCanSleep is a free, open source status bar tool to prevent your Mac from sleeping for a while.

The main point of this tool is to allow the Mac to go back to "I can sleep" mode again after the "no sleep" period is over (hence the name) without having to change Energy Saver settings.

It also includes a feature to watch for folder activity, in order to prevent the Mac to go to sleep during long running tasks (video encoding, downloading, copying, backup'ing, rendering, recording, etc.) automatically, and only for as long as the task is running.
